Funk
====

Simplifying functional programming in Java.

Description
-----------

Funk is a library of functional utilities to aid in writing Java in a functional style.
It currently supports the following main features:

  * Lazy and eager higher order functions for manipulating collections such as `map`, `reduce`, `zip`, `filter`, `take` and `drop`.
  * A full suite of function interfaces for representing different arities of functions, predicates and procedures.
  * Collection literals and builders for assembling collections from various sources.
  * Monadic types such as `Option` and `Either`.
  * Generically typed tuples of different lengths for representing arbitrary records in a type safe manner.
  * Generators for generating potentially infinite streams of objects satisfying particular semantics.
